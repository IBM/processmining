# Installation of IBM Process Mining 1.14.1 - Traditional Installation on RedHat 8

This installation process is for a POC, everything is installed as root, with no password in the database. You can follow the installation documentation to add more security. https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/process-mining/1.14.1?topic=installing-traditional-environments

The installation process includes both process mining and task mining (optional).

There are two choices: Process Mining (PM) and Task Mining (TM) on the same server, or on distinct servers. 

## Installing PM and TM on the same server
That's the easiest.
