# Bank Account Closure Demo
Unzip [IBM - Bank Account Closure.zip](IBM%20-%20Bank%20Account%20Closure.zip)

All the projects used in this demonstration need to be in the same organization (not local).

Create a Process project named Bank Account Closure and load the related CSV file. Use the related backup file (IPD) to map the dimensions and to restore the filters and the dashboards.

Then create the following projects and load their CSV and their IDP files. Naming is important, they have to match the parent's activity names:
- Task Mining: BO Service Closure
- Task Mining: Evaluating Request (WITH registered letter)
- Task Mining: Pending Liquidation Request
- Task Mining: Network Service Closure
